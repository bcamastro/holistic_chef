This is a project I am working on for a chef who wanted a custom website to show off some recipes and have a place
for people to look at to promote themself as a chef. 
This is in very early stages, the chef wanted to see options for design. This is the current design that was laid out. 
The chef will be giving me more info in terms of color and what they want as far as content on the page. 
I made this repository public, as I would like to have it viewable in case any one likes the design for themselves or if any 
one has ideas to contribute to make this page better. 

I am using custom bootstrap, mostly just so I can customize bootstraps colors as the stock bootstrap colors don't represent the 
chefs preferences on color. 

As a reletively newer developer I am looking for ways to improve the code, so if any one has ideas feel free to let me know
and I am open for some criticism on things I could do better!

PS I have it coded in the HTML for the index page with 2 seperate CSS files for different size screens. I am aware I could clean it
up a bit by using media queries in my css file, however I am currently looking for a solution to keep my bootstrap styling on 
my HTML page as well. The only thing I came up with was using full custom CSS at that point. Which is fine, but I would like to learn 
how to do it this way as well. Suggestions on that are also greatly appreciated. 

Thank you for looking at my project!
